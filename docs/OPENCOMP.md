# Semi-Open Competition 

As a try-out, we would like to test how a code competition might progress if we share our code half-way the competition.

We believe that this might provide: 
- an option to learn from eachother: solutions, directions and/or tactics.
- easier access for first-time competitors to see everybody's approach and build upon their idea's
- a stronger competition for experienced developers!

If you want to join in this semi-open competition ( highly recommended!)
- Send us an email for to become member of this competition
- At the submission date of first round: provide us your code (as written in the email communication)  
- We calculate all the score, and will share everyone's code to the semi-open competition members
- Second round : you can change/upgrade your code! and deliver your final solutions at the second-round date 

Your final score will consist of the sum of the first and second(final) round. 

# Soft rules
- Do not copy somebody's code, but you can copy concepts/idea's.

It's not allowed to directly copy somebody's code, but ofcourse it's encouraged to see what kind of tactics are applied by other competitors, which will help you to refine your own code and the other way around!
