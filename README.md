# Splitter

Welcome to the *Splitter* Code Competion repo.

## Game

The idea and rules of the game can be found [here](GAME.md)

## Goal :goal_net: 

The goal is to make the best bot for completing the Splitter game using the stdin/stdout of a program
The bot with the highest points after 200 rounds wins!
To compare the bots fairly, we will use the same 200 random seeds for each bot.   

## Expectation

Its pretty simple to make a bot that just randomly places the numbers on valid places but it gets much harder once you actually try to connect the numbers for more points!

## Competition

Besides the Best Score competition, you can also go for 
- The Creative Solution 
     - Use your imagination and create the most stunning visual presentation of the game.
- The Nerdiest Solution :nerd_face:
     - Do something nerdy or awesome with the idea of this competition. For example: Use a obscure development language. Or go nuts with Lego, Rasperry Pi's, .. 

## Team Up... Semi-Open Competition!
Ofcourse it's okay to team up. 
Share your idea's and approaches in your team!

This time we also introduce an Semi-Open Competition. The members of the Semi-Open Competition will compete in two rounds. After the first round, everyone's code is shared. 
Read [more about the semi-open competition](OPENCOMP.md). 


## Submission
On the end of the competition you can :

Deliver us your solution, with build instructions and the arguments required for executable to run and we will test it and note down the score (the average score after 200 games).
There is a time limit of 15 minutes so if it takes longer than that to complete 200 games you will be disqualified.
You can expect 100 games of each of the two board layouts. 

## Credits

This Code Competion is based on the Splitter board game.
