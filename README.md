# Splitter

Welcome to the *Splitter* Code Competion repo.

## Game

The idea and rules of the game can be found [here](GAME.md)

## Goal :goal_net: 

The goal is to make the best bot for completing the Splitter game using the stdin/stdout of a program

The bot with the highest points after 1000 rounds wins!
 
<!-- ## Offline
This is an *offline* code competition meaning that your code doesn't have  -->

<!-- ## Expectation
Although the first levels are doable, even by hand, the levels get trickier and harder to solve. Don't feel upset if you have a hard time reaching anything beyond level 50 or 100 or...It just get's really hard very fast.  -->

## Expectation

Its pretty simple to make a bot that just randomly places the numbers on valid places but it gets much harder once you actually try to make it connect the numbers for more points!

## Competition

Besides the Best Score competition, you can also go for 
- The Creative Solution 
     - Use your imagination and create the most stunning visual presentation of the game.
- The Nerdiest Solution :nerd_face:
     - Do something nerdy or awesome with the idea of this competition. For example: Use a obscure development language. Or go nuts with Lego, Rasperry Pi's, .. 

## Team Up!

Ofcourse it's okay to team up. Share your idea's and approaches in your team, but we discourage to share actual code.

## Submission

On the end of the competition you can :

Deliver us your solution as executable or script(python,js,ruby etc) and the arguments required for executable to run and we will test it and note down the score.
There is a time limit of 10 minutes per run so if it takes longer than that to complete 1000 games you will be disqualified.
