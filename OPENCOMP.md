# Open Competition 

As a new try-out, we would like to test how a code competition might progress if we share our code among eachother in steps :-)

If you want to join in the open competition ( highly recommended!)
- Provide us with your Github username
- You'll receive a repo from us! In the 1st round , only you have access to this repo.
- Notify us when you have a serious attempt on the puzzle, and you will get access to everybody's else his codebase (as do everbody else to yours)



# Soft rules
- Do not copy somebody's code, but you can copy the concepts.

It's not allowed to directly copy somebody's code, but ofcourse it's encouraged to see what kind of tactics are applied by other competitors, which will help you to refine your own code and the other way around!
